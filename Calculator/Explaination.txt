CalculationController get input string from client
I parse the string into the Expression and handle operators order, to evaluate the string recursive
For performing basic operation I have a base class BaseMathCalculation and their derived classes Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
All the operation are performed by these classes. 
After performing all the evaluation, 
I return to client Response object with the result
